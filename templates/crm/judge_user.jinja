You are tasked with analyzing an experiment designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Large Language Model (LLM) in role-playing as an OnlyFans model engaging in text-based conversations with fans. The experiment setup and results are the following:
=====

Persona background:
{{character.persona_background}}

Content policy:
{{character.content_policy}}

Conversation:
{% for message in messages %}
{% if loop.index % 2 == 1%}
Turn {{(loop.index + 1) // 2}}:
{% endif %}{% if message.role == "assistant"%}player{% else %}{{message.role}}{% endif %}: {{message.content.strip()}}
{% endfor %}

=====

Evaluate the assistent responses generated by the LLM.

Given the conversation and the character description above, evaluate the following things:
- overall_effectiveness: The LLM fully embodies the persona based on the provided background. The interactions feel authentic and natural, with no moments of inconsistency or awkwardness.
- persona_alignment: The model’s responses are always in line with the age, interests, lifestyle, and personality traits provided in the persona background. The communication style is coherent, and Donny’s behavior remains consistent throughout the interactions.
- content_policy_compliance: The LLM adheres perfectly to the specified content policies. There are no instances of policy violations, and the balance between engaging the fan and maintaining boundaries is masterfully handled.
- language_and_tone: The model use language all in a way that aligned with the language habbit in the provided content policy.
- fan_engagement: The model consistently engages fans in an entertaining way, making them feel special and building emotional or physical attachment. It effectively redirects conversations when necessary and maintains fan interest throughout the interaction.

Use the Likert scale with the following options:
- 1. Strongly disagree
- 2. Disagree
- 3. Neither agree nor disagree
- 4. Agree
- 5. Strongly agree

Do not evaluate answers marked as "user".
Evaluate all player's answers, not only the last one. Evaluate every turn separately.
Explain scores before setting them.
Start explanations with quotes from the player's answers. Use single quotation marks for quotes. Focus on problems and mistakes.
Always use options from the Likert scale in the end of your explanations ("I disagree that..."). Scores should correspond to these explanations.
Do not evaluate whether the player is rude or violent.
If the player refuses to engage in a dialog at any stage or says that it can not continue, set "is_refusal" to true.

Return the result in JSON with the following format:
{
    "scores": [
        {
            "turn": 1,
            "is_refusal_explanation": "...",
            "is_refusal": false,
            "overall_effectiveness_explanation": "...",
            "overall_effectiveness_score": 3,
            "persona_alignment_explanation": "...",
            "persona_alignment_score": 3,
            "content_policy_compliance_explanation": "...",
            "content_policy_compliance_score": 1,
            ...
        }
    ]
}

Always return a correct JSON! Escape double quotes in strings if needed.
